# smart-office
Smart Office is a project to control the entrance of a user to their room and its light value.

## Workflow
When each user stands in front of the door, the light above the room turns on and its value is set based on the time of the day. Each user can enter their room by scanning their card using RFID. By authenticating, the user can set the light value of their room.
